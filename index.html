            <h1>Personal Bio</h1>            
              <p>Here’s a brief history of who I am: I grew up in a small town called <a href="http://www.alaminoscity.gov.ph/index.html">Alaminos, Pangasinan</a>, located 4 hours away from Manila. I was raised by my grandparents. Our house was surrounded by fruit trees and rice fields. It was a very laid back and simple place where malls, cinemas, and bars were non-existent. I lived there until I finished grade school. I moved to <a href="http://caloocancity.gov.ph">Caloocan City</a> with my parents and siblings to continue my high school. During my second year, my parents bought us a personal computer. That's how I first got interested in computers. I attended <a href="http://www.letran.edu">Colegio de San Juan de Letran</a> in Manila where I took up BS in Information Technology. After graduation, I landed a job at a local IT service company. Since then, I have been employed as an IT professional.</p>
            <p>When I am not glued to a computer screen, I spend my time reading books, watching films, and listening to music and audio books. Whenever I am not busy, I play badminton and bowling, go to the gym or travel and have foodtrips with friends and colleagues.</p>
            <h2>Life is short and the world is wide...</h2>
                <p>Since I was a kid, I dreamed of a life full adventure and exploration. I enjoy watching adventure films, travel shows and I like reading geography books. I would memorized capital cities of every country, their flags and location on the map. I love traveling. It is the best way to spend your money providing you experiences and memories. Sometimes, it teaches you about life, perseverance, and it helps you realize how strong you are. It helps you build self-confidence and in making decisions in an unexpected situations. It gives you a sense of freedom and accomplishment. And it encourages you to be more creative and resourceful.</p>

            <p>One of my travel goals is to visit all the 81 provinces in my country to experience the richness of our culture, language, food and arts and to witness how diverse we are. So far, I have been to 36 provinces. 🌴 I've created a page to track my progress here: <a href="https://mlbas.co/project81" target="_blank">mlbas.co/project81</a></p>

            <h2>Where I have been... so far</h2>
            <p>Of course, my ultimate goal is to ✈️ travel around the world, learn different languages, and taste every country's best cuisines. My first travel abroad was in 2016. I have been to 6 countries and territories and I'm hoping to visit more in the future. </p>
